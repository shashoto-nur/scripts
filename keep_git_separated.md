It's possible to keep the `.git` directory in a separate location from your project's working directory. This is known as a "separate work tree" or "detached work tree" configuration. It can be useful in scenarios where you want to manage the repository from a central location while having the working directory on a different path.

Here's a basic example of how you can achieve this:

1. **Create a new Git repository:**
   ```bash
   mkdir my_repo.git
   cd my_repo.git
   git init --bare
   ```

2. **Initialize your working directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   git init
   ```

3. **Set up the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin /path/to/my_repo.git
   ```

4. **Push your initial code to the remote repository:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin master
   ```

Now, the `.git` directory is in the `my_repo.git` folder, and your working directory is separate. You can perform Git operations like commits, branches, and merges from the working directory, and the repository data will be stored in the separate `.git` directory.

Keep in mind that managing repositories this way might have implications for collaboration and sharing code, so it's important to understand how this setup fits into your workflow. If you're working in a team, make sure everyone is aware of and agrees with the chosen repository structure.
